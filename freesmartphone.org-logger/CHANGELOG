Version 0.4.0 (20/07/2009)
==========================
* Glade file path not hardcoded anymore.
 Now tries to look for the file in the script directory, and one
 above, possibly under share/openBmap. As the usual structure will
 be [path]/bin/script and [path]/share/openBmap/glade_file. This
 allows installing the application anywhere using distutils.
* Application logging level now in config file.
* New graphical interface.
* Added new image file to distutils.
* Added cells seen statistics.
 Now manages seen cells (servings / neighbours) counters:
 - total since launch
 - number of cells since last start (gets updated only when logging)
* Improve final logging message schedule.
 When exiting, the last message to log should now be
 the last one. It was possible before to see the
 message be printed before the real end of the logging
 output.
* GUI: GPS panel switches when fix status changes.
* FIX: sometimes both windows were invisible.
