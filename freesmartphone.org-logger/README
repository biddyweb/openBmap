openBmap logger version 0.1

What you should expect:
* generation of logs
* upload of logs

Manual:
Interface is straightforward.

* A button to start generating logs. Values will be displayed when
valid. Logs are stored under HOME/.openBmap/Logs by default.
* A button to stop generating logs.

Note that at the moment, the GSM part gets updated only after
receiving an asynchronous update from the network. This
means at start time, it is normal the GSM part does not display
GSM information, even if you are registered to network.

* A button to upload. This will block the interface until every log has been uploaded.
This means that if you do not have Internet connection up and
running, the GUI will be frozen until timeout of the upload part.
After succesfull upload, the logs are moved to 
HOME/.openBmap/Processed_logs by default.

Warning: you should create an account on realtimeblog.free.fr
website, and fill the login/password in the configuration file
before upload works.

* A button to exit.

Config file and application log are located under HOME/.openBmap
directory by default.

Known bugs:
* when you are generating logs, and you press 'Stop' button.
  A popup window let you know you should wait for the logger to
  finish stopping. Under FSO M5, if you press the power
  button, the phone suspends. You press it again it wakes up.
  Nevertheless the GUI is frozen. You will have to kill the
  process.
